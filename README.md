# üöÄ Lighthouse Performance Testing

This project automates **frontend performance testing** using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) via CLI.  
I have taken example of an CRM application to study how Lighthouse Performance Testing works

The script:
- Logs in to your CRM app (via Puppeteer).
- Runs Lighthouse on a list of authenticated URLs.
- Generates **individual HTML performance reports** inside the `reports/` folder.

## üì¶ Tech Stack
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime)
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) (login & navigation automation)
- [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) (performance audits)
- [Chrome Launcher](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher) (used by Lighthouse)
